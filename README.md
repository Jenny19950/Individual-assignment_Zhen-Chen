# Bird Observation Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bird observation data from the FeederWatch program across different survey stations in the USA. The goal is to explore bird population distribution, seasonal trends, and the impact of environmental factors using data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques.

This prject includes four sections:

1\. Data set Overview

In this section, we introduce the data source and key variables for analysis

2\. Data handling section

In this section, we apply tidyr and dplyr to manipulate data.

3\. visualization section

In this section, we use ggplot to create different figures and map observational data on the map. we display bird observations trend over time and visualize the spatial distribution of survey sites.
